Motor Vehicle Collisions in New York City: Data Analysis
Overview:
This project aims to analyze motor vehicle collision data in New York City to uncover patterns, trends, and insights regarding road safety and traffic incidents. The analysis utilizes a dataset obtained from data.gov containing information about motor vehicle collisions in NYC.

Analysis Steps:
Data Exploration: The dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, and exploratory analysis was conducted to understand its structure, features, and basic statistics. This involved examining data types, checking for missing values, and visualizing key metrics.
Identifying Patterns and Trends: Time series analysis was performed to understand the trends and patterns of motor vehicle collisions over time. This included plotting the number of collisions by date and decomposing the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components.
Segmenting and Grouping: The data was segmented and grouped based on relevant attributes such as borough and time of day. This allowed for deeper insights into collision patterns across different geographic areas and throughout the day.
Key Findings:
Temporal Patterns: The analysis revealed temporal patterns in motor vehicle collisions, including fluctuations over time and seasonality. Notably, a significant decrease in collisions was observed during March 2020, coinciding with the implementation of COVID-19 lockdown measures.
Geographic Variations: Collisions were grouped by borough, highlighting variations in collision rates across different areas of NYC. Additionally, segmenting collisions by hour of the day provided insights into peak traffic periods and potential risk factors.
Trend Analysis: The trend component of the time series analysis indicated the overall direction of collision rates over time, while seasonality revealed recurring patterns such as daily, weekly, or monthly fluctuations.
Future Directions:
Further Analysis: Additional analyses could include investigating the factors contributing to collisions, such as weather conditions, road infrastructure, and driver behavior.
Predictive Modeling: Building predictive models to forecast future collision rates based on historical data could help identify areas at higher risk and inform targeted interventions for improving road safety.
Data Visualization: Enhancing data visualization techniques to create interactive dashboards and maps could facilitate better communication of insights and engage stakeholders in road safety initiatives.
